1. In general Ive found that I understand the sequence of git command, what they do and how to apply them. But when Im working with git/GH the concepts lose clairity. I posted a similar note to my discussion group and recieved responses that I was not alone. 

Proper workflow questions I had were answered. I was confused about when to merge branches, when to make a branch, when to add files into branches, when to add to GH. But now I have a better grasp on it. 

2. Althought I was set up to take this GPS last monday, my assigned pair wanted to reschedule. I agreed to it and so did our guide, but then he switched to a different session. I was left to do it alone... then I missed my assigned session. I really wish I worked thos out with anohter person. 

3. As said in (1), there still is some confusion about workflow, I think that as I keep working with git and GH this will start to become clear. 

4. I was originally in the Bumble Bee cohort and did my GPS 1.1 with a pair then. After week 2 I elected to reset myself because outside work had unexpecidly gotten heavy right when I began week 0 and was not in the mindset (anxiety) to absorbe info in weekly assignments. I say that bc I'll reflect on my Bumble Bee GPS...

It was stressful, Ive played a lot of sports in life and it felt like the first game of the season, I had the feeling that everythign I learned just flew out the window and I could not orientate myself. But now I ve been in multiple pairing sessions and feel much more comfortable.
